            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>What is a local AI model?</summary>
                <p>A local AI model is a type of artificial intelligence that runs directly on your computer or device, rather than relying on a connection to a remote server (the "cloud").  This has several advantages:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Privacy:</b> Your data doesn't leave your device, which is crucial for sensitive information.</li>
                        <li><b>Security:</b>  Reduced risk of data breaches since your data isn't transmitted over the internet.</li>
                        <li><b>Speed:</b>  Local processing is often faster than sending data to a remote server and waiting for a response.</li>
                        <li><b>Offline Access:</b> You can use the AI model even without an internet connection.</li>
                        <li><b>Cost Savings:</b> You don't have to pay for cloud computing resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What are automated agents?</summary>
                <p>Automated agents are AI programs that can perform tasks and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Think of them as virtual assistants that can handle specific jobs or workflows.  They use AI techniques, like natural language processing and machine learning, to understand information, make decisions, and take actions. They are highly customizable and can be designed to fit a very wide range of applications.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can you help me set up an AI model on my computer?</summary>
                <p>Yes, definitely! I specialize in helping individuals and businesses install and configure local AI models. This includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Assessing Your Needs:</b> Determining the best AI model for your specific requirements.</li>
                        <li><b>Installation:</b>  Installing the necessary software and dependencies.</li>
                        <li><b>Configuration:</b>  Setting up the model and ensuring it runs correctly on your hardware.</li>
                        <li><b>Training (if needed):</b>  Helping you fine-tune the model with your own data, if applicable.</li>
                        <li><b>Ongoing Support:</b>  Providing assistance with any issues or updates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </details>
             <details>
                <summary>What locations do you serve??</summary>
                <p>I am based in Indiana and primarily serve clients within the state. I am local to the 47201 area, but can offer remote support and services as well as on site services.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Do you offer coding tutoring?</summary>
                <p>Yes, I offer comprehensive coding tutoring services. My tutoring covers both:
